jquery.mtgallery.js
---------------------

Jquery image gallery made for Markus Thyberg  plugin that takes
a list of links for mixed media and turns it into a little
image gallery, embedding the content of the original links.

e.g.

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.image.com/image.jpg">Anything</a></li>
    <li><a href="www.youtu.be/videoId">Text</a></li>
</ul>

Will become a gallery with 2 slides, one of which being an embedded 
youtube video.

Large images are resized and positioned absolutely within the 
thumbnail and main viewer, so they display correctly no 
matter the size or orientation.
